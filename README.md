ProjectSphere 🚀

ACEM ProjectSphere is a secure, all-in-one project submission and mentoring platform designed for colleges. It allows students to upload their project work (source code, reports, PPTs, videos, synopsis) and enables mentors and admins to efficiently manage, review, and track submissions — all with built-in chat support.

✨ Inspiration

Just after my birthday on July 4th, I found myself stuck — my mentor wasn’t viewing my messages, and I couldn’t get the support I needed for my project.

That’s when an idea struck me 💡 —
What if there was a single platform where:

Students could upload everything securely 📂

Mentors could easily track, review, and chat with students 💬

Admins could manage users and assignments effortlessly ⚙️

And that’s how ACEM ProjectSphere was born! 🚀
